# AutoFlex Experiment Results

This repository contains the experiment results for the AutoFlex project. The experiment aimed to evaluate the performance and effectiveness of the AutoFlex framework in automated machine learning (AutoML) tasks.

## Files

- `datasets/`: This directory contains the datasets used in the experiment. The datasets are in various formats, such as CSV and Excel files. These datasets represent different problem domains and serve as the input for the AutoML process.

- `AutoFlex Python code.ipynb`: This Jupyter Notebook file contains the implementation of the AutoFlex framework in Python. It includes the code for algorithm selection, hyperparameter optimisation, feature engineering, and model evaluation using scikit-learn and related libraries.

- `Experiment - AutoFlex.ipynb`: This Jupyter Notebook file details the experimental setup, methodology, and the results of the AutoFlex experiment. It provides step-by-step instructions on how to reproduce the experiment and analyse the obtained results.

- `h2o_excel_file.xlsx`: This Excel file contains the results obtained from the AutoFlex experiment using the H2O AutoML framework. It includes information such as model performance metrics, execution times, and other relevant statistics.

- `tpot_results.xlsx`: This Excel file contains the results obtained from the AutoFlex experiment using the TPOT framework. It includes information similar to the H2O AutoML results file, showcasing the performance and execution times of the models generated by TPOT.

- `AutoFlex Results/`: This folder contains CSV files that provide detailed results for each dataset used in the experiments. Each CSV file corresponds to a specific dataset and includes performance metrics, model evaluations, and other relevant information.
